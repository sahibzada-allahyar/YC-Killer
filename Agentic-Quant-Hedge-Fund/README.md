# Agentic Quantitative Trading by Singularity Research

### Fully autonomous Hedge Fund, run end-to-end entirely by AI agents.

> 🌟 **Join Our Mission**: We're systematically democratizing quantitative finance by open-sourcing enterprise-grade trading systems that rival the most sophisticated hedge funds. If you have a stellar academic background and are excited about making advanced quant strategies accessible to everyone, please star this repository and [apply to join our team](https://www.singularityresearchlabs.com).



A complete, production-ready agentic quantitative trading system that brings institutional-grade algorithmic trading capabilities to everyone. Our mission is to democratize quantitative finance and break down the barriers that have kept sophisticated trading strategies locked behind the walls of elite hedge funds.

## Our Mission

We believe access to advanced quantitative trading strategies is a human right in the modern financial system. While hedge funds charge 2% management fees and 20% performance fees for strategies built on decades-old infrastructure, we're creating cutting-edge AI-powered trading systems and making them freely available to everyone. Our goal is to accelerate financial democratization and give retail traders the same tools used by institutional giants.

## Our Team

Our team consists of the most brilliant quantitative researchers and AI engineers in the world, including alumni from:
- Google DeepMind
- Harvard University
- MIT
- Stanford University
- Cambridge University
- Anthropic
- Citadel

## Usage

### CLI Usage

1. **Generate a trading idea**:
   ```bash
   python -m agentic_quant.cli idea
   # Output: Saved → artifacts/ideas/idea_a1b2c3d4.json
   ```

2. **Convert idea to alpha expressions**:
   ```bash
   python -m agentic_quant.cli alphas artifacts/ideas/idea_a1b2c3d4.json --n 5
   # Output: Saved → artifacts/alphas/alpha_idea_a1b2c3d4_5.json
   ```

3. **Build features for a symbol**:
   ```bash
   python -m agentic_quant.cli build artifacts/alphas/alpha_idea_a1b2c3d4_5.json BTCUSDT
   # Output: Feature hashes with computed parquet files
   ```

4. **Run backtest**:
   ```bash
   python -m agentic_quant.cli run-backtest <feature_hash> BTCUSDT 1h
   # Output: Backtest results with performance metrics
   ```

### Docker Usage

1. Build the container:
   ```bash
   docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t agentic-quant .
   ```

2. Run with docker-compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker/compose.yaml up
   ```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| OLLAMA_BASE_URL | Ollama API endpoint | http://localhost:11434 |
| OLLAMA_MODEL | LLM model to use | llama3 |
| CONTEXT_SIZE | Maximum context size | 32000 |
| PARALLEL_EXECUTION_LIMIT | Concurrent operations | 4 |
| DEBUG | Enable debug logging | false |

### Data Pipeline Configuration

Expected directory structure:
```
data/
├── raw/                    # Never committed to git
│   └── binance/
│       └── futures/
│           ├── quotes/     # Tardis quote data
│           └── trades/     # Tardis trade data
├── processed/              # OHLC parquet files
│   └── {symbol}/
│       └── ohlc/
│           └── {freq}/
└── features/               # Computed alpha features
    └── {hash}/
```

## Example Alpha Expression

The system generates expressions like:
```
ts_zscore(div(sub(high, low), close), 30)
```

Which computes: "30-period z-score of the high-low range normalized by close price" - a classic volatility-based mean reversion signal.

## Performance Benchmarks

- **Data Processing**: 1M+ rows/second with Polars
- **Expression Evaluation**: 10K+ expressions/second with Numba
- **Backtesting**: Full universe simulation in minutes, not hours
- **Memory Efficiency**: Streaming pipeline handles datasets larger than RAM

## Development

### Scripts

- Run tests:
  ```bash
  python -m pytest src/agentic_quant/tests/
  ```

- Type checking:
  ```bash
  mypy src/agentic_quant/
  ```

- Format code:
  ```bash
  black src/agentic_quant/
  ```

### Architecture

The system operates through several key components:

1. **Strategy Generation**: AI agents generate trading ideas and convert them to mathematical expressions
2. **Expression Engine**: Parses and compiles mathematical formulas using Lark grammar
3. **Data Pipeline**: High-performance data loading and feature computation
4. **Backtesting Engine**: Mean-variance neutral backtesting with realistic costs
5. **CLI Interface**: Comprehensive command-line tools for workflow management

```python
from agentic_quant.data.features import FeatureSet

# Create and build features
fs = FeatureSet.from_expr("1h", "ts_zscore(close, 30)")

```

#### Backtesting
```python
from agentic_quant.backtest.engine import backtest

# Run backtest on feature data
